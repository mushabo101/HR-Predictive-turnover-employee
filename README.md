**Problem Statement:** Predict the probability of a candidate looking for a new job

Essentially, I'll be attempting to predict who is job-seeking and who is not.

Note - The main focus of this notebook is on data visualization so the predictive models can almost certainly be improved upon with some basic tweaks.

Remember though, in industry it is difficult to deploy models that take hours to retrain daily. A good model is often better - and more practical - than a perfect one. Although this should be assessed on a case-by-case basis of course.
